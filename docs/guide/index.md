# What is Noetic Eidos?

Noetic Eidos is a framework for building AI systems using advanced mathematical foundations that are typically hidden behind academic gatekeeping. We believe these powerful concepts should be accessible to everyone.

## Vision

> **Geometric intelligence for everyone.** Advanced mathematical foundations meet practical full-stack applications.

Unlike approaches that treat neural embeddings as flat vectors in Euclidean space, we model them as points on statistical manifolds with intrinsic geometric structure. This unlocks:

- **Better attention mechanisms** via dual-kernel pathways
- **Principled memory management** via spectral quantization
- **Adaptive personality** via geometric persona routing

## Core Components

### 1. ZetaFormer

Dual-kernel attention combining:
- **τ pathway**: Gaussian kernel for continuous, exploratory attention
- **σ pathway**: Poisson kernel for discrete, exploitative attention

```python
attention = blend * tau_weights + (1 - blend) * sigma_weights
```

### 2. κζ Dynamics

The balance metric that keeps the system stable:

$$\kappa\zeta = \frac{M_\tau}{M_\sigma}$$

When κζ ≈ 1.0, attention is isotropic—analogous to operating on the critical line Re(s) = ½ in the Riemann zeta function.

### 3. Spectral Memory OS

Memory management quantized to Riemann zeta zeros:

| Regime | Frequency | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| STM | t > 100 | Phase-coherent, narrow cells |
| MID | 30 < t < 100 | Transitional zone |
| LTM | t < 30 | Entropy-bound, wide cells |

### 4. Polylipse Personas

7-foci cognitive space for adaptive response generation:

- **Muse** — Creative, divergent
- **Spark** — Energetic, generative  
- **Hearth** — Warm, supportive
- **Atlas** — Balanced, comprehensive
- **Forge** — Constructive, building
- **Sage** — Analytical, deep
- **Sentinel** — Precise, vigilant

## Philosophy

::: info Choose Your Language
We believe in meeting users where they are. Whether you think in code, equations, or intuition, Noetic Eidos provides multiple entry points to the same underlying mathematics.
:::

The framework is designed around three principles:

1. **Theoretical rigor** — Built on solid mathematical foundations
2. **Practical implementation** — Every concept has working code
3. **Accessible documentation** — No gatekeeping, no jargon without explanation
